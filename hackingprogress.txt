The album opens with a cosmic ripple of 84' cybersynth; a spectral, slow-moving soundscape that feels like a cruise through the retro neon-lit streets of a virtual city at dusk.

The second track emerges as a nostalgic midnight drive, showcasing the subtle complexities of the 80s synthwave. A soothing composition, it channels the listener through a digital realm of rhythmic pulsations and analog twilights.

Merging into the third track, a gradual, progressive increase in tempo signals the dawn, evolving the soundscape from a nocturnal synth journey into a vibrant, early morning cybernetic symphony.

The fourth track is a gentle transformation, as the early rays of sunshine infiltrate the digital realm, leaving twinkling hints of what's to come. The energy begins to shift from the slower cybersynth to something more upbeat.

With the fifth track, we land squarely in the heart of the late 90s, as the cybernetic symphony starts harmonizing with cheerful, chirpy elements of j-pop backing beats.

The sixth track blossoms with optimism, where sunlit J-pop melodies dance with the progressively faster cybersynth, painting a blissful fusion of both worlds.

The seventh track explores the energy of j-pop, the sunny melodies bouncing against the backdrop of a nostalgic synth soundbed. Itâ€™s a jubilant celebration, a joyful parade through the digital metropolis.

Track eight ushers in a sense of nostalgia - a nostalgic reflection of the journey so far, still harboring that upbeat j-pop energy while the tempo subtly starts preparing the listener for the next transition.

The ninth track plays as a crossroads of the late 90s J-pop and the incipient happy house beats, an exciting mixture that bursts with the enthusiasm of an era's transition.

The tenth track is a sweet symphony of mixed emotions - the joyous anticipation of the coming evolution meets the farewell to the cheerful j-pop era, a bittersweet serenade echoing through the digital city.

Track eleven marks the beginning of the new phase. The familiar chords of the past tracks start accelerating, reviving the 90s J-pop tunes into pulsating happy house beats.

The twelfth track builds upon the energetic atmosphere, layers of familiar melodies now pulsating at a brisk pace, an euphoric journey into the heart of a digital dance floor.

The thirteenth track plunges fully into the happy house genre, the chords from the past forming an energetic mosaic of fast-paced dance beats, creating an uplifting audio spectacle.

As the fourteenth track plays, we're engulfed by a wave of positivity and ecstasy, the happy house beats mixing with neon-tinged chords, a rhythmic, foot-tapping celebration in full swing.

The fifteenth track, while retaining the happy house fervor, starts subtly introducing elements of nostalgia - a sonic reminiscence of the journey from cybersynth to j-pop, and now to the house.

Track sixteen is a climactic rave in the heart of the digital city. It's a joyous crescendo that combines all the musical elements of the journey so far into a powerhouse of pulsating rhythms.

The seventeenth track winds down from the previous frenzy, the happy house energy simmering down into a more reflective melody, setting the stage for a thoughtful climax.

As the eighteenth track plays, the tempo slows down even further, turning the bright, daylit house beats back into a twilight-infused, slower-paced synth wave, a gentle reminder of the album's starting point.

Track nineteen serves as a poignant finale, a beautiful convergence of all the musical styles explored in the album - the cybernetic night, the j-pop dawn, the happy house day - all merging into a breathtaking sunset melody.

The twentieth and final track is a hushed nocturne, a tranquil end to the vibrant journey. It's an ethereal melody that intertwines the digital memories of the album into a nostalgic lullaby, drawing the curtains on this euphonious exploration of time and genre.
